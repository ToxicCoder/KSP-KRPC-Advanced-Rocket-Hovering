# Adding custom targets
Adding new targets is accomplished with the `addNewTarget.py` script

Run the script and switch to KSP - the rocket should start to hover
You can then fly manually to the location you would like to save and pause KSP
In the console ctrl-C the program and you'll be asked

`Would you like to save this location? (y/n):`

If you choose **_n_** the program will exit. If you choose **_y_** you will be asked to enter a name.

`Please enter a name for this location:`

After entering a name you will be asked

`Is this location on a small landing pad? (y/n):`

If you chose yes the main program will spend more time perfecting its position.

And that's all you need to know to start adding custom locations
