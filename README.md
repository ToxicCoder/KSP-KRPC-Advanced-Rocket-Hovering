# KSP-KRPC-Advanced-Rocket-Hovering
This is a script made using Python and KRPC for KSP (Kerbal Space Program) that can hover a craft and transport and land it at a target position
The hover function is derived from gist.github.com/djungelorm/01b597163491a3ed0bce

The modules used in the code are: krpc and time
which can be installed via pip3 krpc time

You do need to install the KRPC mod for Kerbal Space Program. You can use CKAN or use this link: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130742-15x-to-122-krpc-control-the-game-using-c-c-java-lua-python-ruby-haskell-c-arduino-v048-28th-october-2018/

You can simply run from the command line using python3 AdvancedHover.py
